# ENGR3430-Eclectronics-FinalProject

## Description

This project is for the Eclectronics Final.

Here, we have a RPI2040 to connect to an ESP32-WROOM-32 (just for WIFI use) as well as an LCD screen in order to  connect to the internet, read someone's *Now Playing* information using the Spotify API Spotipy, and display the song on the screen. There is also a circuit for light detection, which is used to create a "light" and "dark" mode on screen. All of these are communicating with the RPI2040.
